# airbnb-amsterdam

## Project overview
This project and the associated code is meant to serve as an assignment project for the partial fulfilment of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. The project involves analysis of Airbnb data using CRISP-DM method, and we focus on the Airbnb data from the city of Amsterdam. The primary goal is to analyse the data and present the findings. For details related to the project as well as the findings, see the blog post [here](https://debjani-ism.medium.com/analysis-of-amsterdam-airbnb-dataset-e3ac9beb3551).

## Project structure
This project structure is divided into two directories:
- ams-airbnb-amsterdam: Contains the two ipynb notebooks on analysis and modeling.
  - Airbnb_Amsterdam.ipynb: Contains scripts for analyzing the data of Airbnb Amsterdam.
  - Modelling.ipynb: Contains script for fitting regression models for price prediction.
- Data: contains files with airbnb data from Amsterdam.

## Additional information
The code presented in the two scripts has been tested with Python 3.6 and Pandas 1.1.3. In case problems exist, feel free to post query and I will be responding as soon as possible.
